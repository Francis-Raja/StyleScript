    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSuper Mario Bros., the first side-scrolling 2D platform game to feature Mario, was derived by collaboration of Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., which starred two characters: Mario, the titular character that first appeared in Donkey Kong as the original player character and its sequel where he was a final boss, and Luigi, who first appeared in Mario Bros.The etymology of adding "Super" to the title came after deciding to integrate the Super Mushroom into the game.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMario usually saves Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom and purges antagonists, such as Bowser, from various areas; since his first game, Mario has usually had the role of saving the damsel in distress. Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in Donkey Kong from Donkey Kong. Pauline was soon replaced by Princess Peach in Super Mario Bros., although Pauline has reappeared in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series and is considered "Mario's friend" instead. Mario reprises his role of saving Peach in the Super Mario series, but Mario himself was rescued by Peach in role-reversal in Super Princess Peach. Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaraland in Super Mario Land, but Luigi has since been more linked to her; in Super Smash Bros. Melee, the text explaining Daisy states that "after her appearance in Mario Golf, gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach.</p>
